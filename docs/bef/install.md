## Installing Eclipse and the Bazel Eclipse Feature

This page documents how to get up and running with Eclipse and the Bazel Eclipse feature.
These instructions are for **users that just want to use** the Bazel Eclipse feature.


### Supported Platforms

We will support you on:
- Mac - reasonably recent OS versions, latest Eclipse
- Linux - reasonably recent OS version, latest Eclipse

We are looking for help to support:
- Windows - not tests


### Supported Eclipse

We recommend the latest release of [Eclipse IDE for Java Developers](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/).
Given the language server is our priority, we may need to adopt new APIs quickly.

### Installing Bazel

The Bazel Eclipse Feature does not come with an embedded install of Bazel.
You must have Bazel binary (`bazel`) installed on your machine and in your shell path.

We recommend Bazelisk or another wrapper which supports `.bazelversion`.


### Installing the Bazel Eclipse feature into Eclipse

**Manually Install the Bazel Eclipse feature into Eclipse:**

If you want to install the latest version of BEF, follow these steps to install it in your Eclipse IDE using the update site:

- Start Eclipse.
- In Eclipse, go to *Help* -> *Install New Software*
- Click the *Add* button
<!-- markdown-link-check-disable-next-line -->
- For the location, enter: **https://eclipseguru.github.io/bazel-eclipse/latest/**
- Give the location a name, like *Bazel Eclipse*
- In the tree control area, open the *Bazel Eclipse* node
- Check the box next to the *Bazel Eclipse Feature* item, then hit *Next*
  - Note: Don't install the *BJLS Feature*. You must leave that unchecked.
- Click *Next/Agree/Finish* until it completes.
- Restart Eclipse

**To verify that it is installed:**
- Start Eclipse
- *Eclipse* > *About* > *Installation Details* > *Click on the Plugins Tab* > *search for Bazel*: the feature's plugins should be in the list
